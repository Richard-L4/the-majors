# The Majors
[The Majors Project](https://richard-l4.github.io/the-majors/)
 In the world of Golf there are four 'Major' tournaments each year that every golfer who is eligible to compete in wants to win. These are the tournaments that a professional golfer's success is judged by the number of major's they have won. The image below is of the 18th hole at The Royal and Ancient Club of St Andrews Scotland. St Andrews is widely regarded as 'the home of golf', this is the place where of all the venues where the Open championship is held a player most wants to win.

## Introduction
- I wanted to create a website for anyone who may have an interest in golf. Someone who may have seen a small amount on TV or radio and have an interest to know a little bit about the sport, an overview. 
- It is designed to provide a very base oversight of the big championships that are held each year, where they are held, and the dates.
- A brief history of the two golfers who are widely acknowledged as the founding fathers of the game.
- The trophy itself that goes to the player who wins the tournament and is introduced as "The champion golfer of the year and the winner of the Gold Medal". 

## User Experience
- My aim was to create a clean, crisp website that is easy to use, presents the information in a short, concise manner.
- On all pages the user can easily navigate to any part of the site they want to.
- I was keen that even on a small screen the information is presented well.

## Design
- I initaly used Balsamiq to create a skeleton idea for each page of the site.

## Development 
- During the project my ideas changed several times as to how to structure it and the conent and styling to use. Below are challenges I faced and the reasons as to the decisions that were made.
- 
## Features
- I designed the site to have individual pages to create a cleaner, clearer user experience including a separate "Enquiry" button taken from Bootstrap and then modified and styled to suit the style of the site that is situated slightly away from the main menu tabs.
- The "Enquiry" page has a custom button with a hover feature to reassure the user that that is how to submit their details and the message they wish to send.
- I created a "success" page to give instant confirmation to the user that their message has been successfully submitted, with a link to take the user back to any part of the site they would like to go to.


## Future
In the future I would like to add more pages, giving far more detail of the game of golf and it's history, it's champions, both male and female with video clips of the very best at their best with a comprehensive frequently asked questions section.

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Lighthouse.

## Testing
- I used  dev tools and inspect on the preview page to test at first point how the project looked on all screen sizes as a first stage.
- I later tested the site for usability on my own personal phone as well as my own I pad to simluate different screen sizes in a 'real world' environment.
- As an added measure of testing I sent a link of the GitHub site to a friend who is a Developer so he could give me feedback on how he found the site from a user and profession perspective.
- Finally, I connect my laptop to a 2nd screen to see how the site performs on a large screen.

## Validation
- I used HTML and CSS validate.

## Deployment
- To deploy my project I used [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages by commiting and pushing the project from Gitpod to GitHub pages.

## Credits
- During this project I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to provide several code blocks as a base template.
- All of the images used have come from [getty images](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/).
