## Design
- I initaly used Balsamiq to creat a skeleton idea for each page of the site.

## Features
- I designed the site to have individual pages to creat a cleaner, clearer user experience including a seperate "Enquiry" button taken from Bootstrap and then modified and styled to suit the style of the site that is situated slightly away from the main menu tabs.
- The "Enquiry" page has a custom button with a hover feature to reasure the user that that is how to submit their details and the message they wish to send.
- I created a "success" page to give instant confirmation to the user that their message has been successfully submitted, with a link to take the user back to any part of the site they would like to go to.

## Technology Used

- CSS
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Lighthouse.

## Testing
- I used  dev tools and inspect on the preview page to test at first point how the project looked on all screen sizes as a first stage.
- I later tested the site for usability on my own personal phone as well as my own I pad to simluate different screen sizes in a 'real world' environment.
- As an added measure of testing I sent a link of the GitHub site to a friend who is a Developer so he could give me feedback on how he found the site from a user and profession perspective.
- Finally, I connect my laptop to a 2nd screen to see how the site performs on a large screen.

## Deployment
- To deploy my project I used [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages by commiting and pushing the project from Gitpod to GitHub pages.

## Credits
- During this project I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to provide several code blocks as a base template.
- All of the images used have come from [getty images](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/).
